# Sveltkit and GraphQL

## Notes

> Homa and Profile use local graphql (4000), but About page use hasura **(Now it has an cors error)**

## Dev

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Sever

Garage code example graphql - Mios/graphql/garage-code-graphql/graphql-tasks/src/schema.graphql

```bash
http://localhost:4000/
```

## Unocss

Uno in "Sveltekit" example

[Check 'Interactive console'](https://unocss.dev/interactive/?s=amber)


```bash
https://stackblitz.com/edit/unocss-unocss-myuqrf
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
